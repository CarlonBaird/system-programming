# system-programming
This repository contains something little tool writed by C, for personal interests. And every file can be compiled into a executable software.

this part is about some operations of file, including creating, reading, and write. It sounds like `cat` command. But I don't know the original code of `cat` (though I can find it), it was coded by myself and for learning.
